My try with some APIs!
This code will take message attatchments from your gmail and add them to your google drive (under no specified path)

BEFORE RUNNING
You will need to 
> enable the Gmail and Drive APIs for your google account
> set up proper OAuth2 credentials.
> enable Gmail scope: 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly' and Drive scope: 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file'
